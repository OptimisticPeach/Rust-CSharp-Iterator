## Rust-C# iterator
This is an example repository for `ffi`ng between rust and c#, and specifically shows off an example of how to use a rust iterator in C#. Follow along in:
```
csharp_iterator: The rust side of the ffi
RustIterator: The C# side of the ffi, or the recieving side
```
Note: this is ready to run an example, but feel free to edit the rust, build and include it in the c# build, and run.
